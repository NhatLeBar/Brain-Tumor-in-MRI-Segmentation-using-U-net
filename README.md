# Brain-Tumor-in-MRI-Segmentation-using-U-NET
 This is a project for tumor segmentation in 2D MRI brain scans using a convolutional neural network with U-NET architecture.
 In this document, one can find the instructions on how to operate modules used in this model.
 
 All codes can be found in the Python notebook attached.
 
 ## Set-up and initialization
 The three first block codes provide initial set-up for the project.
 The first block is optional since it just provide connection to the Google Drive directory storing the training data.
 The second block is used for introducing libraries used in this project.
 The third block is to initalize constants to be used in the project.
 The NUM_TRAIN and NUM_TEST are to be found with your own dataset using some upcoming modules.
 Meanwhile, the NUM_OF_EPOCHS constant is to be set with your own preferences.
